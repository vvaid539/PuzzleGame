//Reflection: This lab was the hardest lab this year. It used a lot of things that I had forgotten about from syntax to concepts. I
//struggled with filling in the functions left empty especially the matchItems function. Although, I am proud of my work, I fear that 
//it took too much time, and that is something that I will not have on the AP exam.
